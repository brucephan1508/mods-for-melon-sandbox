# Terms of Use

Last updated: December 15, 2025

Welcome to Mods For Melon Playground (the “App”) and any associated website or services (collectively, the “Service”). These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the Service. By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.

## 1. Who may use the Service

You must be at least 13 years old (or the minimum age in your jurisdiction) to use the Service. By using the Service you represent and warrant that you meet this age requirement and have authority to enter into these Terms.

## 2. License to use the Service

Subject to these Terms, the Developer grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to access and use the Service for your personal, non-commercial use. All rights not expressly granted are reserved by the Developer.

## 3. Nature of content / non-affiliation

The App provides a platform to browse, download, preview and export user-created mod files (for example, .melmod and .melsave) for use with third-party games such as Melon Sandbox. The App and its content are fan-made and are not official, endorsed by, sponsored by, or affiliated with Ducky LTD or any game developer, publisher, or trademark owner. All game names, logos and trademarks remain the property of their respective owners.

## 4. User content and license

“User Content” means any files, packs, descriptions, images, videos, comments, or other content you submit through the Service.

By submitting User Content you represent and warrant that you own the rights to the content or have the necessary permissions. You grant the Developer and its affiliates a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable license to host, copy, use, reproduce, modify, publish, distribute, display and otherwise make the User Content available via the Service, and to include the User Content in promotional and discovery features (for example: preview thumbnails, search, and recommendations). This license is for the purpose of operating and promoting the Service and ends when you remove your User Content, except to the extent copies remain in backup or archival systems.

You are responsible for the accuracy and legality of your User Content. You must not upload content that infringes another’s intellectual property or that is unlawful, defamatory, obscene, pornographic, or otherwise objectionable.

## 5. Creator payouts & purchases

If the Service supports paid packs, subscriptions, or creator payouts, purchases are subject to the payment provider’s terms (for example, App Store policies, Stripe terms). The Developer’s payout and fee structure for creators will be posted in the Creator Dashboard and may change from time to time. The Developer does not guarantee any particular level of sales or income to creators.

## 6. Prohibited conduct

You agree not to:

- Use the Service for any illegal purpose or in violation of applicable law.
- Upload viruses, trojans, malware, or any code intended to disrupt or harm the Service or other users.
- Attempt to access, probe, or bypass security of the Service or other users’ accounts.
- Impersonate another person or misrepresent your affiliation.
- Circumvent payment, moderation, or content review systems.
- Upload content that infringes intellectual property rights or contains unlawful material.

## 7. Moderation, removal & takedowns

The Developer may review, moderate, remove or reject any User Content at its discretion and may suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms. The Developer does not control User Content and is not responsible for its accuracy.

If you are a rights holder and believe content on the Service infringes your copyright, please follow the Developer’s takedown procedure available on the Developer website. To expedite removal, rights holders should provide the following information in a takedown notice:
- A physical or electronic signature of the rights holder (or authorized agent).
- Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to be infringed.
- Identification and location of the allegedly infringing material on the Service.
- Contact information for the complaining party.
- A statement that you have a good-faith belief use of the material is not authorized.
- A statement, under penalty of perjury, that the information in the notice is accurate and you are authorized to act on behalf of the rights holder.
The Developer will respond to valid notices and may forward notices to the user who posted the content.

## 8. Disclaimers

THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE DEVELOPER DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. THE DEVELOPER DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE, NOR THAT ANY CONTENT IS ACCURATE OR SAFE.

## 9. Limitation of liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE DEVELOPER BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THE DEVELOPER’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR THE SERVICE SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID TO THE DEVELOPER FOR THE SERVICE IN THE SIX (6) MONTHS PRIOR TO THE CLAIM, OR, IF YOU PAID NOTHING, ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS (USD $100).

## 10. Termination

The Developer may suspend or terminate your access to the Service at any time for any reason, including for violations of these Terms. Sections that by their nature should survive termination (for example, Intellectual Property, Disclaimers, Limitation of Liability, Indemnification, and Governing Law) will survive.

## 11. Changes to the Terms

The Developer may update these Terms from time to time. When changes are material, the Developer will provide notice (for example via the App or email). Your continued use of the Service after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.

## 12. Governing law and disputes

These Terms are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction of the Developer as listed in the App Store (without regard to conflict-of-law rules). If you are a consumer, local mandatory consumer protection laws apply. Any legal action will be brought in the courts of the applicable jurisdiction, unless otherwise required by law.

## 13. Third-party services and links

The Service may contain links to third-party websites or integrate third-party services (for example, payment processors or analytics). The Developer is not responsible for third-party content or services and your use of them is subject to the third party’s terms and privacy policies.

## 14. Privacy

Use of the Service is also governed by the Developer’s Privacy Policy, which describes how personal data is collected, used and shared. Please review the Privacy Policy before using the Service.

## 11. Contact

If you have questions about these Terms, want to report content, or are a rights holder reporting an alleged infringement, contact the Developer using the contact information listed in the App Store or via the Developer website.
