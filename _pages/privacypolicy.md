# Introduction
Welcome to Mods For Fruit Playground (the “App”). Your privacy matters. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect (if any), how we use it, how we share it, the choices you have, and how we protect your information. By downloading, installing, or using the App you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and to the collection and use of information as described below. Unless otherwise defined, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions.

This Policy covers the App’s own practices and, where applicable, the practices of third parties (for example, advertising partners or analytics providers) that you may encounter while using the App.

<br>

## 1. What we collect and why
Short summary: The App is designed to let users browse, preview, download, and export community-created mod files for Fruit Playground. The App does not require account registration and does not collect personal data by default. To provide and improve the Service we may store files and preferences locally on your device, show third-party ads, and—only if you opt in—use optional features that collect more information. Where third-party services operate (for example ad networks), their own policies apply.

We use information only to provide, secure, and improve the Service, to comply with legal obligations, to communicate service-related messages, or to deliver advertising if enabled. Where required by law (for users in the EEA, UK, and Switzerland — the "Designated Countries") we rely on contract performance, legitimate interests, or your consent as the legal basis for processing described below.

<br>

## 2. Information We Do NOT Collect (by default)
The App does not require or collect names, email addresses, phone numbers, or other directly identifying information for normal use.

The App does not upload your downloaded mod files or device contents to the developer’s servers unless you explicitly use an in-app upload/share feature.

If you enable optional features (for example cloud sync, sign-in, or analytics) or grant permissions, we will update this Policy and notify you.

<br>

## 3. What the App May Store or Access Locally
To operate and give you the intended experience the App stores the following on your device:

Downloaded mod files and temporary preview files for offline access and export.

Cached thumbnails and previews to speed up browsing.

App preferences and settings (UI preferences, last viewed folder, language, etc.).

These items remain on your device until you delete them or uninstall the App.
<br>

## 4. Types of Data Collected Automatically (Usage Data)
When you use the App we may automatically collect certain diagnostic and usage information to operate, maintain, and improve the Service. This may include:

Device type and model, operating system version, app version.

IP address and approximate location derived from IP.

Unique device identifiers (for example IDFA if advertising is enabled) and crash/reporting data.

Usage analytics (features used, pages/screens visited, session length).

This information helps us troubleshoot problems, analyze usage patterns, and improve the App. Where required by local law, we will rely on legitimate interests or your consent for this processing in the Designated Countries.

<br>

## 5. How We Use the Information
We use information for the following purposes:

To provide and improve the Service: Deliver core app functionality, manage downloads, display previews, and enhance performance.

To provide customer support: Respond to your questions, troubleshoot, and handle disputes.

To send service-related communications: Administrative messages that are not promotional (you cannot opt out of these).

For security and fraud prevention: Detect and prevent abuse, spam, and unauthorized access.

To comply with law and enforce our rights: Respond to legal requests and protect the rights, property, or safety of users.

To personalize and improve the experience: Remember preferences, and when enabled, provide personalized features.

For research and development: Analyze aggregated usage to improve and build features.

For marketing (only with consent/opt-out available): Send promotional messages or targeted communications; you may opt out of marketing at any time.

If we use your personal information for any purpose not listed here we will disclose it to you.

<br>

## 6. Advertising, Tracking & Third-Party Services
The App may display ads from third-party ad networks. These partners may collect data about your device and app usage to provide, personalize and measure ads. Examples of data they may collect: IP address, device identifiers (including IDFA), and app usage data.

If the App requests permission under Apple’s App Tracking Transparency (ATT), we will present the permission prompt and honor your choice.

To opt out of targeted advertising on iOS, use the system setting to limit ad tracking or deny ATT permission.

Third-party services (ad networks, analytics, crash-reporting) have their own privacy policies — we recommend reviewing them.

<br>

## 7. Data Sharing & Disclosure
We do not sell personal data. We share information only in limited circumstances:

With service providers who perform tasks on our behalf (hosting, analytics, customer support, ad delivery). They are contractually limited to only use the data to perform services for us.

When you choose to share or upload content (for example, when you export or publish a mod file using an in-app feature).

For legal reasons: to comply with law, respond to lawful requests, protect safety, or enforce our rights.

If we share data with third parties (other than the ad/analytics providers listed in this policy), we will update this Policy and disclose the recipients.

<br>

## 8. Your Rights & Choices
Depending on your jurisdiction you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or restrict processing of your personal data. To exercise these rights or make requests (including GDPR or CCPA requests) contact us at brucephan15081999@gmail.com and provide enough information to identify you and the request.

You can also:

Opt out of marketing communications at any time by following unsubscribe instructions in such messages or contacting brucephan15081999@gmail.com.

Deny ATT tracking permission on iOS to limit cross-app tracking.

Delete downloaded mod files or cached content via the App or by uninstalling the App.

<br>

## 9. Retention
Data we collect is retained only as long as needed to provide the Service, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements. Downloaded files and cached previews are retained on your device until you delete them or uninstall the App. Temporary server-side face data (if used) is retained no longer than 24 hours.

<br>

• This App is not affiliated with or authorized by the original game developer or any social media platform.

• Any unauthorized actions (re-uploading or downloading of content) and/or intellectual property violations are the sole responsibility of the user. Downloading copyrighted files without permission may be illegal in your jurisdiction.
